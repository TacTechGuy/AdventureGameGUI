<!-- Adventure Game [Description]-->
<p>
  The Adventure Game is a GUI game developed as a project for one of my CS classes, which was inspired by my daughter. The game was intended as a way to transform her relationship with her stuffie into something digitally to where 
she could interact with it and dictate the outcome based on her choices that she had selected throughout playing the game.

<!-- Adventure Game [About the project]-->
<p>
  While working on this project I became familiar with using various Python libraries including customTkinter, pickle and CTKmessagebox. This was the first time making a GUI using Python, it allowed me to develop my 
  critical problem-solving skills to a different degree to where I could layout the game in such a way that would allow for continued development and future enhancements due to the underlying structure of the
  <a href="https://github.com/TacTechGuy/AdventureGameGUI/blob/master/storyIndexing.jpg?raw=true">game indexing</a> that I had created. To further enhance this, the <a href="https://github.com/TacTechGuy/AdventureGameGUI/blob/master/fileWrite.py">fileWrite.py</a> 
  file allows for easy manipulation of the games sentences which can be modified within the sentences.txt file and the script ran to seamlessly update the StoryFile.txt by first combining the game index's and sentences into a dictionary and 
  then finally writing it to the StoryFile.txt.
